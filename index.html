		<p>Were you inspired by the article on purpose and the respective exercises? Ideally,<strong> the target of your strategy should be directly linked to the purpose of your company</strong>. For example, if your company's purpose focuses on solving the issue of water scarcity, the target of your strategy should include an answer on how to tackle the issue of water scarcity. The target could be to offer affordable solutions to reduce the water consumption of your customers or become the world market leader for technology to clean dirty water and produce drinkable water.</p>
<p>What about the results of the exercises on the materiality matrix of Module 2? The materiality matrix should help you to identify the sustainability dimensions which are most relevant to your business and its context. Together with the respective stakeholders, it would help if you translated these focus domains into concrete targets you want to reach with your strategy.</p>
<p>However, on a central aspect of these discussions - especially when multiple stakeholders with diverging interests are involved - might be the questions about <strong>the scope of your strategy.</strong> The following concept might be helpful to find an answer to this question. You could use it to <strong>structure the dialogue with your stakeholders to clarify your targets' concreteness and scope.</strong></p>

 <p>This category puts sustainability at the core of your strategy and business model and can lead – in an extreme way – to a complete transformation of your current business model. Coming back to the previous example, this would be an airline company that stops operating flights, puts the purpose of connecting people at the core of its strategy, and offers virtual solutions for connecting people. This sounds drastic, extreme and difficult to imagine, but we see example of these categories in reality. Check companies like Patagonia, DSM, Signify and reflect whether you would put them into this category.</p>

<div class="accordion">Sustainability of businesses with a sustainable product or service <i class="fa-solid fa-plus accordion-right"></i></div>
<div class="panel hidden">
	<div class="image-container"><img style="max-width: 100px; width= 100%;" src="images/003.png"></div>
  <p>These are corporate or business strategies that offer a product or service that are aiming at making the world a little bit better. There are plenty examples like companies that offer products made out of recycled material, companies that offer recycling, companies that offer solutions to reduce water consumption, and energy consumption.</p>

<div class="accordion">Sustainability to gain advantages from sustainability <i class="fa-solid fa-plus accordion-right"></i></div>

  <p>These are strategies that aim at creating a competitive advantage through sustainability, either by increasing the willingness to pay of the customer or decreasing the relative costs. While the previous category can be seen as a kind of a functional strategy next to your business and corporate strategy, this category will affect your business strategy as you will be challenging your traditional way of answering the question: how to compete. You differentiate yourself from your competitors by offering a similar product or service but in a more sustainable way. An example would be an airline company that continues to operate flights, but abandons all short time distances and replaces this offering by creating a cooperation with a railway company to bring their customers to the respective airport where their long-distance flight takes off.</p>

<div class="panel hidden">
	<div class="image-container"><img style="max-width: 100px; width= 100%;" src="images/005.png"></div>
 <p>These are strategies that do not really impact the core of your business model, but help you to become more sustainable in a general way. These strategies give direction and coherence to your sustainability ambitions and initiatives. An example would be an airline company that continues to operate flights, but tries to become more environmentally friendly by measures like using bamboo cutlery instead of plastic cutlery, offering the customers to pay an additional fee when booking their flights to donate to a sustainable project, and is looking for options to reduce the CO2 emissions.</p>
